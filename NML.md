 * Genomics 101: Introduction; covers why genomics is useful and how is it conducted
 * Genomics 102: Sequencing Terminology; covers genomics and sequencing language  
 * Genomics 103: Sequencing Technology Evolution; covers the evolution of modern sequencing technologies
 * Genomics 104: Modern Genomics Applications; covers the application of genomics
 * Bioinformatics 101: Introduction; covers the benefits of using bioinformatics tools
 * Bioinformatics 102: The Bioinformatics Environment; covers what it is and an overview of the computing environment of bioinformatics software and an introduction to file formats used 
 * Bioinformatics 103: Bioinformatics Basics; covers the basics of bioinformatics
